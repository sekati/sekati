------ CODENAME: "VARAN" ------



API UPDATE: v3.0.3.10 - "Mothra" (WARNING: API BREAK)
 - sekati.display.BitmapDataCapture deprecated for sekati.display.CoreBitmapData & sekati.display.CoreBitmap
 - Cleanup to events, core package.
 - Various fixes/cleanups.
 - Preparation for codename bump.


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.9 - "Mothra" 
- Preparatory build for sub-version/codename bump:
- Feature additions to CoreSprite, InteractiveSprite, Document, etc.
- core and event package refactorings
- external package updated in prep for a centralized external queue and internalization of all js: BrowserAddress functional
- SWC size shrunk with update ANT Buildfile: no longer includes flex core.
- Documentation updates.
- external package still needs cohesive management for browser readiness.
- Remove ui.components subpackage in exchange for ui.controls
- Removed commands stub package for later implementation.
- Refactored data package into utils.
- Removed unused except package.


v3.0.3.8 - "Mothra" (WARNING: API BREAK)  
- This is an Intermediary Build:
- Tweener (caurina.*) has been removed from the source directory and is now provided as a SWC which is mxmlc and Flash10 IDE compatible BUT NOT FLASH CS3 COMPATIBLE! This means you *must* provide your own source version of Tweener if you are publishing from Flash9 IDE moving forward.
- added lib/tweener.swc
- addition of a new ant buildfile are in progress
- minor changes to deploy
- miscellaneous cleanup and refactoring moving towards a clean issue tracker list.

It is best to avoid building from trunk / 3.0.3.8 if you are not comfortable creating a linked library to tweener.swc or are working on flash-ide centric projects.


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.7 - "Mothra" (UPDATE 1)
- Removed 'index' param options from ContextualMenu.addItem()  due to regression bug in ContextMenuManager natural ordering.


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.7 "Mothra"
- Fixed critical bug in sekati.managers.ContextMenuManager which prevented access to Canvas-level ContextualMenu.
- Added the optional 'index' param to ContextualMenu.addItem which redefines the order (and ID's!) of ContextualMenuItems: This means you can now inject custom context menu items into the API's default root-level context menu in any order you wish!
- Fixed typo in sekati.utils.ArrayUtil

NOTE: This is a maintenance & stability build and will likely be followed by another to implement the last non-functional config.xml option via BrowserAddress deeplink support.


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.6 "Mothra"
- Added sekati.external.BrowserAddress
- Removed sekati.external.SWFAddress
- Removed sekati.events.SWFAddressEvent
- Removed deploy/js/swfaddress.js

This update removes SWFAddress and replaces with a paired down (non-history managed) easy to implement BrowserAddress class which allows for deeplink anchoring, title changes and more with a simple set and check mentality that forgoes the need for browser history simulation.

NOTE: This will likely be followed by another version bump once BrowserAddress has been fully tested and matured - consider 3.0.3.6 an intermediary build.


API UPDATE: 3.0.3.5 - "Mothra"
- Updated to current recommended adobe crossdomain.xml policy file structure.
- Remove crossdomain_uri as a flashVar option (relatively pointless)
- Fixed bug in Bootstrap which failed to construct the proper crossdomain fully-qualified uri from relative crossdoms (not begining with / or http).
- Added Image ui class.


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.4 Mothra"
- Version bump


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.3 "Mothra"
- Relocated sekati.swc to /lib
- Refactored sekati.external.JsBase to sekati.external.ExternalBase
- Updated sekati.profiler.PerformanceMonitor to improve output
- Updated sekati.log.Logger to support Firebug output
- Updated config.xml to support new <log> settings: NONE, CONSOLE, FIREBUG, ALL
(false/true backwards compatible)
- Updated sekati.log helper classes
- Updated/optimized Bootstrap
- Removed App.log property from sekati.core.App
- Refactored sekati.validators.FlashValidator to provide getter properties
- Implemented new config.xml <name> based tracking via sekati.external.Urchin
- Updated sekati.external.Urchin implementation via config.xml/Bootstrap/App

... more good stuff (but may require minor refactoring in past projects
[<=3.0.3.0] for implementation)


API UPDATE: 3.0.3.2 - "Mothra"
- moved sekati.swc to lib/
- adjusted buildfile, removed useless lib/swc directory
- added auto-hotkey for fullscreen/context menu when config'd.
- added launch configuration
- renamed UIAssets to support upcoming components and templating.
- removed unutilized console.


API UPDATE: v3.0.3.1 Mothra"
- Version bump


API VERSION BUMP/BREAK: 3.0.3.0 - "Mothra" (Please read the 3030 Release Notes carefully beforeupgrading current projects)
- major display package changes/adustments:
        * frame/clip based classes deprecated
        * all display class event handlers are now 'e:Event=null' (adjust your previous projects accordingly!!!)
        * Liquid classes no longer use the "_on" convention but are simply: "resize, resizeComplete, fullscreen"  (adjust your previous projects accordingly!!!)
- config.xml changes to support performance monitoring - removed deprecated nodes.
- App/Bootstrap adjustments
- Performance refactored to PerformanceMonitor
- XMLUtil added
- DateUtil rehashed (in progress).
- ui class additions (components/reflections/etc - in-progress)
- service package added (webservice)
- added RemotingService to API for AMFPHP.
- added ServiceEvent

------ CODENAME: "MOTHRA" ------



API UPDATE: Public v3.0.2.9 - "Rodan" (final subpoint release)
- Minor enhancements to TextUtil, FocusToggle


API UPDATE: v3.0.2.8 - "Rodan" 
- Bootstrap cleanup, misc additions, progress and maint. build.


API BREAK: v3.0.2.7 - "Rodan" 
- refactoring sekati.display.TextDisplay to sekati.text.TextDisplay: loader, draw, text updates, additions and refactorings to follow.


API UPDATE: v3.0.2.6 - "Rodan" 
- Cleanup / Refactoring: Public Alpha .


API UPDATE: v3.0.2.5 - "Rodan" 
- ColorUtil, StringUtil, MathBase additions & alterations on AbstractLoader.


API MAINTENANCE: v3.0.2.3 - "Rodan"
- Repaired CSS flaw in Bootstrap


API CLEANUP: v3.0.2.2 - "Rodan" 
- removed useless sekati.display classes, added InteractiveSprite, updated docs, finalized certain classes for speed optimization and unprivatized other for extensibility.


API SHIFT: v3.0.2.1 - "Rodan" (generally backward compatible)
- Core changes to sekati.display.Canvas & sekati.display.Document allow for full API implemented SWF loading into loader swf's and the skipping of the Bootstrap phase via simple override of Document.initAPI(). Please see http://docs.sekati.com/sekati for details.
- These changes should be mostly backwards compatible except save cases of extreme
customization to Bootstrap and/or Document.


API VERSION BUMP: v3.0.2.0 - "Rodan" 
- version starts.



------ CODENAME: "RODAN" ------



API UPDATE: v3.0.1.0 - "Ghidorah" 
- Code names will be assigned whenver a major API break occurs or enough work has taken place to merit both a version and code name bump (this should happen quite often so the associated names in sekati.core.App should assist in project/api match tracking).



------ CODENAME: "GHIDORAH" ------



API BREAK:
- sekati.display.* Sprite compliments to Clip classes added (Core, Liquid, etc). 
- NOTE: the "onAdd" and "onRemove" event handlers have been replaced with the more aptly named "onStage" "offStage" event handler method stubs.


API ADDITION: (UPDATE RECOMMENDED) 
- backwards compatible: check config.xml <config persist="false">...



API FORK: NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Added configuration options to
App/Bootstrap/config.xml to allow for Bootstrap stage skipping.

Future Bootstrap may be replaced with a more flexible config.xml and Command,
ICommand, CommandSequencer package.



------ SEKATI API 3.0.0.x ------
