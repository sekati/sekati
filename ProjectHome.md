**Still here for your 'travel to the past to steal a pair of humpback whales to save the planet' needs!**

**Sekati API** is a Pure Actionscript 3.0 framework designed to bootstrap the development of flash/flex projects & applications with an emphasis on high-level functionality encapsulation. The framework provides a flexible, feature-rich xml configurable application architecture through the implementation of it's collection of behavior-specific core display objects, controllers, managers & utilities.

The frameworks deploy structure, web & Air application skeletons, companion Javascript library, unit & visual tests aid in getting a stable application structure up and running almost immediately.

Amongst the various default application features is a [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) & Eclipse Console Logger (class introspective and leveled) for build and deploy debugging, a Ant Buildfile with tasks for generating project structures, compilation, generating asdoc documentation or SWC libraries and automating deployment via rsync+ssh, graphed performance monitoring memory and FPS, deeplink and polling address monitoring, and much more.

Great attention has been paid to writing thorough and concise [Documentation](http://code.sekati.com/docs/sekati/) for the API and generating useful [Unit](http://code.sekati.com/api/sekati/tests/) and [Visual](http://code.sekati.com/api/sekati/tests/visual/) test to allow the framework to be easily tapped and referenced as needed.

The API has been developed with and leverages the power of the [INDE](http://inde.googlecode.com) (Interactive Development Environment) Eclipse Distribution & is the Actionscript 3.0 successor to [SASAPI](http://sasapi.googlecode.com).
