**SEKATI API** is developed and maintained by  [Jason M Horwitz // Sekati](http://sekati.com), thanks largely to the direct and indirect contributions via knowledge and code sharing of several friends, colleagues and other open source projects.

Ever effort has been made to make mention in source comments when code was derived, adapted or adopted from others work. However, since it can be tricky to track the origin of these things, this space is dedicated to directing your attention to this excellent, though not at all comprehensive list of individuals who's work deserves attention:
